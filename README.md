# QOSF Cohort 10 - Task 2 Noise
This repository contains the code to solve the task 2 of the QOSF Cohort 10 application. 

To solve the problem I'm using the framework Qiskit, which we can run self container on Docker.

## Run the code inside Docker (preferred)
You can run the code examples inside a docker container by just executing:

```
make run
```
This will download an open source image that let's us run Qiskit.
